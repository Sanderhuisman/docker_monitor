# Depcrecated

This component has been deprecated in favor of [@ualex73](https://github.com/ualex73/monitor_docker) his component. This component is not longer maintained and I stronly advise to switch over to the one of ualex73.

## About

This repository contains the docker monitor component I developed for my own [Home-Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) setup. Feel free to use the component and report bugs if you find them. If you want to contribute, please report a bug or pull request and I will reply as soon as possible. Please star & watch my project such I can see how many people like my components and for you to stay in the loop as updates come along.

## Docker Monitor

The Docker monitor allows you to monitor statistics and turn on/off containers. The monitor can connected to a daemon through the url parameter. When home assistant is used within a Docker container, the daemon can be mounted as follows `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`. The monitor is based on [Glances](https://github.com/nicolargo/glances) and [ha-dockermon](https://github.com/philhawthorne/ha-dockermon) and combines (in my opinion the best of both integrated in HA :)).

### Events

The monitor can listen for events on the Docker event bus and can fire an event on the Home Assistant Bus. The monitor will use the following event:

* `{name}_container_event` with name the same set in the configuration.

The event will contain the following data:

* `Container`: Container name
* `Image`: Container image
* `Status`: Container satus
* `Id`: Container ID (long)

### Configuration

To use the `docker_monitor` in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
docker_monitor:
  hosts:
    - url: unix://var/run/docker.sock
      name: Docker
      event: true
      monitored_conditions:
        - version
      containers:
        homeassistant_homeassistant_1:
          switch: False
          sensors:
            - status
            - uptime
            - cpu_percentage_usage
            - memory_usage
            - memory_percentage_usage
            - network_total_up
            - network_total_down
        homeassistant_database_1:
          switch: False
          sensors:
            - status
            - uptime
            - cpu_percentage_usage
            - memory_usage
            - memory_percentage_usage
            - network_total_up
            - network_total_down
        homeassistant_mosquitto_1:
          switch: True
          sensors:
            - status
            - uptime
            - cpu_percentage_usage
            - memory_usage
            - memory_percentage_usage
            - network_total_up
            - network_total_down
```
